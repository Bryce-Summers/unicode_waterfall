3 Stage Computer Animation for projection on building.

#Update: July.14.2017
 - Stage 1 guts are done,
 - letter - letter collisions need some work,
 - collisions shouldn't shoot letters off into the void.
  
 - Stage 2 guts are pretty much done.
 - I'll curl the letters soon if desired.
 - Layout of flowing letters will be done when we transition to the building sized screen.

 - Stage 3 is working fine. Sentance are coming out in the correct order.
