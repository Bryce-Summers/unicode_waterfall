      \2From fairest creatures we desire increase,
   \iThat thereby beauty's rose might never die,
  \n\3But as the riper should by time decease,
\i\4His tender heir might bear his memory:
\n\5But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
\i\1Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
\3Making a famine where abundance lies,
\iThy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
\nAnd tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
\i\5 Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:  
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
\i\4Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'
Proving his beauty by succession thine.
This were to be new made when thou art old,
\n\2And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
Now is the time that face should form another,
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
\i\4Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
